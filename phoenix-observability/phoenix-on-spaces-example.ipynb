    "# Setup a Phoenix observability dashboard on Hugging Face Spaces for LLM application tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "[Phoenix](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix) is an open-source observability library by [Arize AI](https://arize.com/) designed for experimentation, evaluation, and troubleshooting. It allows AI Engineers and Data Scientists to quickly visualize their data, evaluate performance, track down issues, and export data to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we'll see how to deploy a Phoenix observability dashboard on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and configure it to automatically trace LLM calls, providing a comprehensive view into the inner workings of your LLM applications."

    "## Step 1: Deploy Phoenix on Hugging Face Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "While Phoenix offers a [notebook-first option](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/deployment/environments#notebooks) for local development, it can also be deployed as a [standalone dashboard via Docker](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/deployment/environments#container). A long-running, hosted dashboard is a great way to provide a centralized view into your LLM application behavior, and to collaborate with your team. Hugging Face Spaces offers a simple way to host ML applications with optional, persistent storage, and it's support for custom Docker images makes it a great platform for hosting Phoenix - lets see how it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll [duplicate the demo space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/andrewrreed/phoenix-arize-observability-demo)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/duplicate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can configure the space to be private or public, and it can live in our user namespace, or in an organization namespace. We can use the default, free-tier CPU, and importantly, specify that we want to attach a persistent disk to the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: In order for the tracing data to persist across Space, we _must_ configure a persistent disk, otherwise all data will be lost when the space is restarted. Configuring a persistent disk is a paid feature, and will incur a cost for the lifetime of the Space. In this case, we'll use the Small - 20GB disk option for $0.01 per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "After clicking \"Duplicate Space\", the Docker image will begin building. This will take a few minutes to complete, and then we'll see an empty Phoenix dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/empty-dashboard.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Configure application tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a running Phoenix dashboard, we can configure our application to automatically trace LLM calls using an [OpenTelemetry TracerProvider](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/quickstart#connect-your-app-to-phoenix). In this example, we'll instrument our application using the OpenAI client library, and trace LLM calls made from the `openai` Python package to open LLMs running on [Hugging Face's Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/en/index).\n",

      "\n",
      "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize the tech landscape, their increasing complexity and scale have introduced new challenges in ensuring their reliability, performance, and maintainability. Two essential components that have emerged as crucial in addressing these challenges are observability and tracing. In this blog post, we'll delve into the importance of observability and tracing in LLM applications, exploring their benefits, challenges, and best practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Observability in LLMs?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Observability refers to the ability to monitor and understand the internal state of a system, including its behavior, performance, and interactions. In the context of LLMs, observability enables developers to gain insights into the model's decision-making processes, identify potential issues, and optimize its performance. This is particularly important in LLMs, which are complex systems that involve multiple components, such as natural language processing, machine learning algorithms, and data storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is Tracing in LLMs?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Tracing, on the other hand, involves tracking the flow of data and events within a system, allowing developers to understand how different components interact and affect each other. In LLMs, tracing enables developers to identify performance bottlenecks, diagnose errors, and optimize the model's architecture. By analyzing the flow of data and events, developers can pinpoint issues that may be causing slow performance, errors, or other problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is Observability and Tracing Important in LLMs?**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Improved Model Performance**: Observability and tracing enable developers to identify areas of improvement in the model's performance, allowing them to optimize its architecture and fine-tune its parameters.\n",
      "2.  **Error Detection and Resolution**: By monitoring the model's behavior and tracing its interactions, developers can quickly identify and resolve errors, reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.\n",
      "3.  **Enhanced User Experience**: With observability and tracing, developers can ensure that the model provides accurate and consistent results, leading to a better user experience.\n",
      "4.  **Faster Debugging**: By analyzing the flow of data and events, developers can quickly identify and resolve issues, reducing the time spent on debugging and improving overall productivity.\n",
      "5.  **Compliance and Governance**: Observability and tracing enable developers to ensure that the model is compliant with regulatory requirements and industry standards, reducing the risk of non-compliance and associated penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges and Best Practices**\n",
      "\n",
      "While observability and tracing are critical components of LLM development, they also present several challenges, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Data Volume and Complexity**: LLMs generate vast amounts of data, making it challenging to collect, process, and analyze.\n",
      "2.  **Scalability**: As LLMs grow in size and complexity, their observability and tracing requirements increase, requiring scalable solutions.\n",
      "3.  **Data Quality**: Ensuring data quality and accuracy is crucial for effective observability and tracing.\n",
      "\n",
